# AI Deployment Project - Docker & Kubernetes
## ðŸ“Œ Business Vision
This project demonstrates how Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be deployed in a **scalable and resilient production environment** using **Docker and Kubernetes**.  
The solution focuses on predictive maintenance for industrial machines, helping businesses to:

- **Reduce unplanned downtime** by anticipating machine failures.  
- **Optimize operational costs** with timely and accurate maintenance actions.  
- **Improve decision-making** through data-driven insights.  
- **Ensure scalability and high availability** by leveraging Kubernetes orchestration.  

The AI model predicts whether a machine requires maintenance based on parameters such as temperature, pressure, vibration, and noise level.

## ðŸ›  Technical Stack
- **Python 3** â†’ model training, API & application logic  
- **Streamlit** â†’ user-friendly web interface  
- **scikit-learn** â†’ Random Forest classifier for predictive maintenance  
- **Docker** â†’ application and model containerization  
- **Kubernetes (Minikube / kubectl)** â†’ orchestration, scaling, and availability  

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- Train a machine learning model (`train_model.py`) to predict maintenance needs.  
- Deploy the model as a **web application** with Streamlit (`app/app.py`).  
- Containerize the application with Docker (`Dockerfile`).  
- Orchestrate the solution with Kubernetes (`k8s/`).  
- Enable **scalability** and **automatic recovery** with Kubernetes deployments.

## ðŸ“Š Executive Summary

**Problem**: Unplanned downtime in industrial machinery leads to high costs and reduced productivity.  

**Solution**: This project uses AI-driven predictive maintenance to anticipate failures before they happen.  

**Business Benefits**:
- **Lower operational costs** through proactive maintenance.  
- **Increased machine uptime and productivity.**  
- **Scalable and resilient solution** using Kubernetes orchestration.  

**Technology**: Python, Machine Learning, Streamlit, Docker, Kubernetes.  

**Impact**: Consider a manufacturing plant operating **100 machines**, each generating an average of **$1,500 in production value per day**.  
Unplanned downtime of just **1 day per machine** can result in **$150,000 in losses**.  

By reducing downtime by only **2%**, this AI-driven predictive maintenance solution could save approximately **$36,000 per month** â€” translating to **over $400,000 annually** in avoided costs and improved operational efficiency.
